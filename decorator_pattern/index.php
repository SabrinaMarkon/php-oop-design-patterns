// new BasicInspection()) is the $carService argument so a BasicInspection is always included in the price.
echo (new OilChange(new BasicInspection()))->getCost();

// Add another decorator using the one above now as an argument so TireRotation is just added onto it:
echo '<br />';
echo (new TireRotation(new OilChange(new BasicInspection())))->getCost();

// Alternatively, we can ONLY get a TireRotation WITHOUT an OilChange:
echo '<br />';
echo (new TireRotation(new BasicInspection()))->getCost();

// So to make it nice, and use the getDescription() methods as well as getCost()
// Simply set the ordered service variable to what we want for the order:
echo '<br /><br />';
$ordered_service = new TireRotation(new OilChange(new BasicInspection()));

// Then:

echo $ordered_service->getDescription() . ': ' . $ordered_service->getCost();


/*
EXTRA NOTES:
Another way might be with the Composite Pattern as suggested by Kalssin on Laracasts: 
A VehicleServiceCollection class with the method:

public function addServiceComponent(Chargeable $component)
{
$this->components[] = $component;
}

Then each component will implement the Chargeable interface which includes the getCost()
method and you can pass each of the service components to the VehicleServiceCollection instance.
