 public function read(BookInterface $book) {
     $book->open();
     $book->turnPage();
 }
 
}

// Person should be able to read a paper book:
(new Person)->read(new Book);

//(new Person)->read(new Kindle); // DOES NOT WORK because its interface does not match the BookInterface given.
// We have to make an ADAPTER to also be able to 'plug in' the eReaderInterface as we can with the BookInterface.

// NOW Person should be able to read a Kindle without changing the class Person client-code at all, by
// wrapping it in an adapter:
(new Person)->read(new eReaderAdapter(new Kindle));

// Or another kind of ereader can also use the eReaderAdapter:
(new Person)->read(new eReaderAdapter(new Nook));
